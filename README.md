# React Native Drawing App

- Simple Drawing App Demo made with React Native
- User can draw, clear, rewind stroke, and save a drawing.
- Added a background image as a test.
- It works for both iOS and android

## References
- I have taken the library rn-draw (https://github.com/jayeszee/rn-draw.git) and modified it as I was not able to achieve all the functionalies I needed as a library.
